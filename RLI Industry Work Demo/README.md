# RLI Industry Work Demo
## Overview
This project is a mock demonstration of SQL reporting, performance optimization, and business intelligence development inspired by my internship experience working with insurance analytics. The materials included illustrate how complex relational and XML-based data was transformed into report ready datasets and interactive dashboards designed to support actuarial analysis.
Due to confidentiality and data privacy requirements, all database structures, table names, and dashboard data has been modified or covered. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate technical workflow design, query development, reporting automation, and performance improvement strategies rather than replicate systems.

## Project Objectives
- Demonstrate real world SQL reporting and data preparation workflows
- Showcase XML data extraction and multi table relational querying
- Highlight query optimization techniques used to improve runtime performance
- Illustrate development of reporting datasets used in Power BI dashboards
- Demonstrate automation of actuarial reporting processes traditionally maintained through manual spreadsheet workflows

## Project Components

### RLI SQL Demo Query
The included SQL query demonstrates complex reporting logic used to prepare policy data for analytics.

#### Key Features
- Multi table relational joins across policy, contract, actuarial, and mapping datasets
- XML data extraction using CROSS APPLY and XPath queries
- Conditional aggregation logic based on business rules
- Policy version control filtering to ensure reporting accuracy
- Business rule filtering for active and valid policy data
This query simulates production style reporting logic designed to feed business intelligence dashboards and analytical reporting systems.

### Runtime Optimization Documentation
The runtime improvement documentation outlines my performance optimization ability applied to SQL reporting queries.

#### Optimization Techniques Used
- Restructuring Joins
- Indexing
- Redesigning filtering logic
- Removing redundancies
- Combining temp queries
- Using 1 or 2 CTEs instead of 3-5 temp tables
- Seemingly insignificant format changes that held larger effects than thought
    - Changing from ‘ ‘ column renames to [ ] when having 25+ columns. 
These improvements demonstrate an understanding of scalable database design and performance-aware query development.

### Power BI Dashboard Examples
This document contains sanitized screenshots of interactive dashboards built using reporting datasets derived from SQL workflows.

#### Dashboard Highlights
- Multi-query data model integration
- Custom DAX measures supporting advanced aggregation and reporting
- Interactive filtering and segmentation capabilities
- Automated reporting workflows designed to reduce manual Excel based analysis
These dashboards were designed using established frameworks to align with company expectations while implementing data modeling, query integration, and visualization logic.

## Impact
The reporting workflows demonstrated in this folder were designed to streamline performance analysis and reduce reliance on manual spreadsheet based reporting. By centralizing data sources and automating calculations through SQL queries and Power BI dashboards, I helped improve reporting efficiency, reduced potential for manual error, and provided actuaries with faster and more interactive access to critical metrics.
